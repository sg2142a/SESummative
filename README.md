# Summative Assignment for the Software Engineering course

## Introduction to Assignment and Project
This assignment tasks us with the creation of a web app using the HTML, CSS and JavaScript stack. Importantly, the processes undertaken in creating such an app must be demonstrated and the use of project management tools and planning techniques discussed.

The project undertaken for this assignment was a simple currency converter, giving the user the opportunity to choose an amount, either in Great British Pounds or American Dollars, and allowing for swift conversion to the other. It should provide a quick and convenient option for currency conversion for a user.

## Tools used in project
The selected project management tool to host this project was Github. It is a free tool allowing users to manage code, using Git software, which itself provides version control, bug detection, continuous integration and task management amongst many other features.

For the purposes of prototyping the app, Figma was used, which is an application for interface design. One huge advantage of Figma is that it provides the option for a user to copy designs or parts of design as CSS code, reducing the coding burden and allowing users to be able to create their designs in front of them before transferring to code, rather than trial and error methods or similar.

The code stack of the web application will have three languages used, those being the aforementioned HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language that is the foundation of the app, providing the required structure to the content on a website. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) takes the structure and layout of the site from HTML and styles it, and finally, JavaScript allows for the content to be made interactive. In this scenario, the HTML will define the site's structure, the CSS things such as colour and font, and the JS is what allows for the conversions to be made.

## Prototype Design
As discussed above, the Figma tool was used to design the prototype of the app, which can be seen below. At this stage, this was for the purposes of understanding what the application could look like rather than than being a strict design to be followed. This allows room for creativity where needed and as the solution develops, requirements and/or concepts may change, and the design can do the same with it.
