# Summative Assignment for the Software Engineering course

## Introduction to Assignment and Project
This assignment tasks us with the creation of a web app using the HTML, CSS and JavaScript stack. Importantly, the processes undertaken in creating such an app must be demonstrated and the use of project management tools and planning techniques discussed.

The project undertaken for this assignment was a simple currency converter, giving the user the opportunity to choose an amount, either in Great British Pounds or American Dollars, and allowing for swift conversion to the other. It should provide a quick and convenient option for currency conversion for a user.

## Tools used in project
The selected project management tool to host this project was Github. It is a free tool allowing users to manage code, using Git software, which itself provides version control, bug detection, continuous integration and task management amongst many other features.

For the purposes of prototyping the app, Figma was used, which is an application for interface design. One huge advantage of Figma is that it provides the option for a user to copy designs or parts of design as CSS code, reducing the coding burden and allowing users to be able to create their designs in front of them before transferring to code, rather than trial and error methods or similar.

The code stack of the web application will have three languages used, those being the aforementioned HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language that is the foundation of the app, providing the required structure to the content on a website. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) takes the structure and layout of the site from HTML and styles it, and finally, JavaScript allows for the content to be made interactive. In this scenario, the HTML will define the site's structure, the CSS things such as colour and font, and the JS is what allows for the conversions to be made.

## Using Agile methodology to manage the project
Agile methodology will be used to manage this project. It is a project management method that focuses upon continuous development and improvement. The project is completed incrementally, allowing for the customer to constantly know the status of the project and to be able to give feedback so improvments can be made. Unlike a linear method such as waterfall, which has a set of requirements that are difficult to change, and means that the client receives little opportunity to be involved in the process, Agile works in short cycles known as "sprints", and has outputs available that allow for collaboration.

In a below section, it will be discussed how tasks within the project are divided into issues that can be submitted through the project management tool being used (GitHub Projects). Typically, Agile methods have a number of developers working on it, so being able to organise tasks in a method such as a kanban board (discussed below) is extremely useful, because it allows all members of the team to understand where each element of the project is, and allows for greater ease in dividing workload. As, in this case, it is just me developing the solution, this is not as important, but having good documentation will make things easier as I can track my own progress and easily demonstrate to stakeholders where I am at as well.

## Initial Kanban board to represent project tasks
One Agile method that I used to manage this project was a kanban board. This is a tool that presents each task to be completed as a card, that can be placed into one of multiple columns depending on how far through the process it is. In this case, my initial kanban board can be seen below, with four phases- to be done, in progress, in review and completed. Throughout the course of the project, this tool can be used to help me keep tabs on exactly what is going on with my project, allowing me to understand exactly where I am and what I need to complete.

## Prototype Design
As discussed above, the Figma tool was used to design the prototype of the app, which can be seen below. At this stage, this was for the purposes of understanding what the application could look like rather than than being a strict design to be followed. This allows room for creativity where needed and as the solution develops, requirements and/or concepts may change, and the design can do the same with it.

## Stakeholder Feedback
At this stage, having been using the Agile methodology, I took the opportunity to source feedback from stakeholders on the design of the product. I used a [Google form](https://forms.gle/okG33S6KpxcWyrvK7) to do this, asking stakeholders whether they thought this was a good design and providing the opportunity for any comments they may have wanted to make.
